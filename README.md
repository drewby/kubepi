# kubepi
Set of scripts to provision and manage a kuberenetes cluster on raspberry pi. 
This script automates provisioning of raspberry pi onto a master and set of slave
nodes.  It assumes the master is also a network gateway and the slaves are not 
directly connected to the "public" network.  

# Attributions
* The code for provisioning the master node is based on the excellent 
guide from Alex Ellis at https://github.com/alexellis/k8s-on-raspbian
* Bash Wizard was used to generate the script with input parameter handling. https://github.com/joelong01/Bash-Wizard
